```

## Running

cmd for running TODO
```shell
Run ./rr processes.txt x
Where processes.txt has the number of processes and process ID, arrival time, and burst time for each process
```

results TODO
```shell
Given the example processes.txt,
Average waiting time: 7.00
Average response time: 2.75
```

## Cleaning up
